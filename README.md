# cs-370
repo for the cs370 class at SNHU
In this project, I was provided with certain foundational code, specifically the implementations of the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes, which handle the maze environment and experience replay functionality, respectively. My primary task was to create a reinforcement learning agent using deep Q-learning to navigate the maze effectively. I developed a qtrain function to implement the training loop, where the agent interacts with the environment, takes actions, learns from rewards, and adjusts its policy based on a neural network's Q-value predictions. The main work I contributed involved designing and tuning the Q-learning algorithm, creating the neural network model for Q-value approximation, and structuring the experience replay for stable learning.
Throughout this course, I learned about fundamental principles like algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving methodologies. Computer science is all about creating efficient solutions to problems using systematic approaches and computational tools. Computer scientists often work on abstracting and generalizing real-world issues into models that can be solved computationally, such as the Q-learning model in this project. This work is critical because it drives advancements in areas like artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering, leading to innovations that improve various aspects of daily life, industry, and research.
My approach to problem-solving in this project involved several structured steps: I first understood the problem requirements, analyzed the existing code, and identified gaps where new code was needed. I then implemented an iterative approach, developing core functionalities, testing as I progressed, and refining my methods. This systematic approach, from analysis to testing, is fundamental in computer science as it ensures that solutions are robust, scalable, and adaptable to future modifications.
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to ensure that the solutions I develop are reliable, fair, and secure. For the end user, this means creating systems that prioritize user safety, privacy, and accessibility. For the organization, it entails aligning with best practices, maintaining data integrity, and supporting goals responsibly. In the case of AI, for instance, it's essential to consider bias, transparency, and user autonomy. These responsibilities reflect the broader need for technology to serve users positively and contribute meaningfully to society.
